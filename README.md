## Introduction

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the complex nature of financial markets and the multitude of factors that can influence stock prices. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical stock price data and identify patterns that can be used to make predictions about future price movements.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Historical stock price data for Tesla (TSLA) is collected from reliable sources such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data is preprocessed to clean, normalize, and transform it into a suitable format for training machine learning models.
  
- **Model Training**: Machine learning models, such as regression models or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are trained using the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships between input features and target variables (stock prices).
  
- **Prediction**: The trained models are used to make predictions about future stock prices based on new input data or historical data not used during training.
  
- **Evaluation**: The performance of the predictive models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess their accuracy and reliability.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras (for deep learning models)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

1. you either Clone the repository or you can open it in collab:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kaleabendrias/AI_Class_proj.git
    ```


## Usage


2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the collected data to clean, normalize, and transform it into a suitable format for training machine learning models.

3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships between input features and target variables.

4. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to make predictions about future stock prices based on new input data or historical data not used during training.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the predictive models using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess their accuracy and reliability.
